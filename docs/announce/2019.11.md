# Announce: Rakudo Star Release 2019.11

Just in time for the end of the year, Rakudo Star 2019.11. Only the second
release this year, compared to the usual four releases per year, but it beats
having only a single one.

Many systems received a couple slight tweaks in order to keep them working for
newer releases. Some of these received them only to make them easier to
understand for me. After a lot of hard work, and with help from people all
around the community, this release was made possible.

A big thanks to everyone involved!

## Changes

- The build system itself received some rigorous changes. All work is now done
  in the `work` subdirectory, instead of in the root directory. A number of
  scripts were altered to output some more information as well, which is mostly
  intended to help Rakudo Star maintainers figure out issues.

- Perl 6 is being renamed to Raku, and this is the first Rakudo Star release
  containing `raku` as executable. It's just a symbolic link to `rakudo` right
  now, but it allows you to run programs usin `raku`.

### Ecosystem Modules

- `Linenoise` has been dropped in favour of `Readline`. This also got
  `LibraryCheck` included, as this is a dependency for `Readline`.
